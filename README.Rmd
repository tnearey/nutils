# nutils

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package nutils is to  provide utilities I found useful particularly in early debugging scaffolding.
Some simple functions 
catln  -- just cat with a "\n" appended, analagous to python3 print(). Name inspired by ancient Pascal writeln.
showvars -- show variable names and print its contents.



## Installation

You CAN'T install the released version of nutils from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nutils")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(nutils)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
